//! HID++ writes back to the device — DPI, SmartShift, lighting, backlight, and
//! diagnostics.
//!
//! Each entry point takes a [`DeviceRoute`] and resolves it to an open channel
//! through `open_route_channel`, so the same call works whether the device is
//! behind a Bolt receiver or attached directly (USB cable / Bluetooth). Each
//! route-addressed call re-enumerates and re-opens, while the corresponding
//! `_on` entry points reuse a [`SharedChannel`] already owned by inventory or a
//! standalone capture session.
