//! Hardware-side actions invoked from both the GPUI thread (slider release)
//! and the OS-event hook thread (bound button press).
//!
//! [`DeviceOp`] is the seam every device write and read goes through: it binds
//! a [`DeviceRoute`] to the agent's capture/inventory channels (built via
//! [`crate::orchestrator::SharedHandles::device`] or
//! [`crate::orchestrator::SharedHandles::keyboard_device`]), then either
//! awaits [`DeviceOp::run`] (the IPC server's reads/writes, which must report
//! their result to the GUI) or fires [`DeviceOp::detach`] (the OS-hook and
//! reconnect paths, which must never block their caller). Both resolve the
//! channel the same way every caller always did — a registry-confirmed
//! capture channel or the exact current inventory channel; a registry miss is
//! unavailable, never a fallback to re-enumerating and opening a competing
//! connection.
//!
//! `detach` spawns a one-shot tokio runtime on a dedicated OS thread — cheap
//! at the cadence these fire at (≤ once per slider release / button press)
//! and avoids holding a long-lived async runtime alongside GPUI's executor.
