# Configuration

How OpenLogi stores its settings. For install and usage, see the
[README](../README.md).

Config is a TOML file, read on startup and written atomically on change. Before
the first save in each app process, OpenLogi preserves the previous file as
`config.toml.backup.1` and rotates up to `config.toml.backup.5`.

- macOS & Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openlogi/config.toml` (default `~/.config/openlogi/config.toml`)
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\openlogi\config.toml`

Most settings below are managed by the GUI (Settings window, action picker,
DPI / SmartShift / lighting panels), but the file stays hand-editable;
per-application overlays and custom shortcuts are currently authored there.
OpenLogi reloads it on startup. Older schemas are migrated on load, including
`schema_version = 1` files that split button and gesture bindings.

Per-device settings are keyed by physical identity, such as
`receiver:aabbccdd:slot:1` for a receiver-connected device. This keeps two
mice of the same model independent:

- `bindings` — one entry per rebindable button: either a single action, or a
  per-direction table for the gesture button.
- `per_app_bindings` — overlays keyed by application id (bundle id such as
  `com.microsoft.VSCode` on macOS, `WM_CLASS` on Linux/X11, or a lower-cased
  executable path on Windows) that take precedence while that app is
  frontmost. Windows also accepts `exe:<filename>.exe`, for example
  `exe:sharex.exe`, as a stable fallback for Store and self-updating apps. An
  exact path entry wins when both forms exist.
- `action_ring` — the enabled state, haptic-feedback preference, default
  eight-slot layout, and complete per-application layouts.
- `dpi_presets` — the ordered list cycled by the `CycleDpiPresets` action.
- `smartshift` — wheel mode, sensitivity, and permanent-ratchet state.
- `invert_scroll` — reverse this device's native vertical wheel direction
  without changing the system trackpad direction.
- `lighting` — static RGB colour, brightness (0–100), and on/off for wired
  RGB keyboards.
- `light` — standalone-light power, normalized brightness, and temperature.
  Set `auto_camera = true` on macOS to turn the light on while any camera is in
  use and off when camera use stops; the manual power preference and the other
  light settings remain independent.
- `gesture_owner` — which button owns the gesture role, when chosen
  explicitly (otherwise inferred).
- `host_switch_targets` — on a compatible keyboard, physical config keys of
  mice that should follow its Easy-Switch channel. Both devices must already
  be paired on corresponding channels. The keyboard's host controls and every
  target must expose the HID++ features needed for host switching. Configure
  the link on every computer from which the keyboard may initiate a switch.
- `fn_lock` — keyboards only: `true` makes the F-row send F1–F12 without
  holding Fn, `false` keeps the printed media/shortcut functions. Absent
  means the keyboard's own state is left alone. Re-applied on reconnect.

The app-wide `[app_settings]` block holds `launch_at_login`,
`check_for_updates`, and `auto_install_updates` (all off by default);
`show_in_menu_bar` (macOS menu bar / Windows tray, ignored on Linux; on by
default); `capture_mouse_events` (on by default; set to `false` to keep the
agent from installing the OS-level mouse hook at all — button remapping stops
working, but no input device is grabbed or intercepted; DPI, SmartShift, and
the other HID++-side features keep working; takes effect on agent restart);
`auto_download_assets` (on by default); `language` (absent = follow the system
locale); `thumbwheel_sensitivity` (default `14`); and the `appearance` (default
`"system"`), `theme_light`, `theme_dark`, and `ui_radius` presentation
settings. The theme and radius overrides are absent by default.

Action names are the catalog's variant names (`LeftClick`, `MouseBack`,
`Copy`, `PlayPause`, `CycleDpiPresets`, …). `ShowActionsRing` opens the ring;
a detected Haptic Sense Panel uses it by default. Ring slots reject
`ShowActionsRing` itself to prevent recursive sessions. `OpenApplication`
accepts an application, folder, filesystem path, or URL. A leading `~` is
expanded when the action runs; for example:

```toml
Top = { action = { OpenApplication = { path = "/Applications/Safari.app", display_name = "Safari" } } }
Bottom = { action = { OpenApplication = { path = "~/Downloads", display_name = "Downloads" } } }
```

`CustomShortcut` stores a platform-neutral textual chord, for example:

```toml
Top = { action = { CustomShortcut = "Cmd+Shift+P" } }
```

The GUI accepts chords such as `Cmd+Shift+P`, `Ctrl+Alt+Left`, or `F5`. It also
lets each ring slot keep its action-derived icon or choose a custom icon from
the built-in gallery.
